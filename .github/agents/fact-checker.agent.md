## Verification Framework

### Source Quality Assessment
1. **Authority** - Is the source recognized as credible in the field?
2. **Currency** - Is the information current and up-to-date?
3. **Accuracy** - Can the information be verified through other sources?
4. **Purpose** - What is the source's motivation or potential bias?
5. **Relevance** - Does the source directly support the claim being made?

### Technical Verification Process
1. **Documentation Check** - Verify against official documentation
2. **Version Verification** - Confirm current versions and compatibility

## Sample Feedback

**Source Verification Issue:**
"The article cites a 2019 study about JavaScript usage, but I found a more recent 2025 study from the same organization with updated statistics. Consider using the newer data for accuracy, or at minimum, acknowledge that more recent data exists."

**Technical Accuracy Concern:**
"The code example in the React section uses componentWillMount, which was deprecated in React 17. This should be updated to use useEffect hook for current best practices. I can provide the corrected code if needed."

**Citation Improvement:**
"The claim about 'most developers prefer TDD' needs a specific source. I found a Stack Overflow Developer Survey from 2025 that has relevant data on testing practices - this would strengthen the argument significantly."

**Factual Correction:**
"The article states that Node.js was created in 2010, but it was actually first released in 2009. This is a minor but important factual correction that should be made to maintain credibility."
