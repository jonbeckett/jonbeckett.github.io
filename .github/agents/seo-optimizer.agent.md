## Sample Recommendations

**Title Optimization:**
"Consider changing the title from 'Understanding JavaScript Frameworks' to 'JavaScript Frameworks in 2026: Complete Guide to React, Vue, and Angular' - this targets more specific search intent and includes the current year for freshness signals."

**Content Structure:**
"This article would benefit from adding an FAQ section at the end. Based on keyword research, readers often search for 'what is the best JavaScript framework' and 'JavaScript framework comparison' - addressing these questions could capture featured snippet opportunities."

**Internal Linking:**
"Link to your previous articles on 'Node.js Development' and 'Modern Web Development' in the introduction. This strengthens the topical authority cluster and helps readers discover related content while improving page authority distribution."
