Hi – I’m Jonathan.

While not bashing my head against the desk repeatedly or sitting in conference calls pretending to be clever, I write idiotic blog posts, occasionally trudge around town in running shoes, and attempt to survive living in a house with four women and two cats.

I live in deepest, darkest England – land of good manners, punctuation, starched shirts and silent indignation. I grew up near Oxford and now live in the countryside just outside London.

I like pizza, wine, chocolate biscuits, coffee, cult movies, 80s music, and retro computers and video games.
