Does 3am still count as "New Year's Eve" ?


It's been a strange year.


The loss of friends and family members in the last couple of years has brought into focus that we really do only get one go at this - that we should somehow "make it count". If only somebody wrote some instructions on how to go about doing that. It would make everything so much easier. The lack of a rule book is how we find ourselves though - sometimes putting one foot in front of the other really is the best way.


I started writing this many hours ago. In the interim we watched the Barbie Movie, then wandered over to a friend's house and helped them ring in the new year together.


I'm still processing "The Barbie Movie" (is that what it's actually called?). The flippant side of me wants to make a glib comment about happily watching Margot Robbie for hours - but another side perhaps doesn't want everybody to know that the movie tore me to shreds towards the end.


It will surprise nobody to learn that the scenes in "Love Actually" of families meeting in airport arrival halls completely destroyed my composure, and continues to do so. I'm far too soft. Probably.


While making up the numbers at the dinner table this evening I accidentally got into conversation with the father of a friend and discovered his history with technology and teaching. I seem to have a particular skill for unlocking the "motherlode" download of eveything about people. For the better part of half-an-hour he related much of his career to me and I couldn't help but be drawn in.


I love listening to people's stories - how they arrived at where they are. I'm not sure if I can differentiate between loving people, or their stories - or if the stories are what make a person. I like people - which is an odd thing for somebody so shy to say.


Yes. I'm shy.


In the real world I can't hide behind a username or an avatar. It takes me a while. My cousin in California sat across the table from me in a bar one night many years ago and said "your walls are made of mud, and I am the rain". She wasn't wrong. I've never forgotten. That was probably twenty five years ago now.


Tonight a good friend caught my gaze with a smile more than once. Sometimes that's all it takes to get me from today to tomorrow.


Anyway.


I really must stop thinking so much. I need to sleep. It's 3am.


Happy new year.


Let's see where the next lap around the sun takes us.
