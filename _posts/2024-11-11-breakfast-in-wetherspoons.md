Today marks the first day of my second "staycation" - the second of three in the run-in towards the end of the year.

After scraping myself out of bed a little before 8am, having a shower, shave, and getting dressed, I wandered into the kitchen just in time to cross paths with my other half leaving for the day. She has some time off later in the week - to similarly burn through unused holidays (use them or lose them).

I'm currently sitting in Wetherspoons - the cavernous new pub in town. I might have succumbed to a cheap cooked breakfast on account of us not having anything to put on toast at home - part of the reason for the walk into town in the first place.

What wonders might I acquire from the supermarket - breakfast and supper options for the store cupboard at home? Jam? Peanut butter? Marmite? Marmalade? Chocolate spread? We'll see, I suppose. You can almost guarantee that if I go in with specific things in mind, they will be sold out - mostly because it's me, and the universe / TV show I'm undoubtedly starring in tends to do that sort of thing to me.

A group of unseen young men arrived a few moments ago. They are sitting in the booth behind me, trying desperately to be the funniest guy in the room. Their entire humor seems to revolve around lines from television shows, or making derogatory comments about anybody and everybody.

Why?

What happened to being interesting or original?

Where was I.

Oh yes - the TV show.

Have you ever noticed how the worst thing that can happen invariably does? Not the big things - the hundreds of small things during the day. They add up. I'm not saying it's all rigged - that would be far too "MAGA" - but perhaps that the world at large takes cues from it's surroundings, and takes advantage where it can.

I've always wondered how quiz shows like "Who wants to be a Millionaire" would play out if the contestants just answered the questions, and nothing more - because if I was running one of those shows, there's no doubt I would change the next question according to what they're having difficulty with - what they're letting slip in their "conversation" with the host.

An old man sitting adjacent to me - a table away from me - has just started watching television on his mobile phone. At full volume. He's watching GB News pedal some made-up right-wing conspiracy clap-trap. How do people even begin to believe that stuff?

It's taking advantage again, isn't it. An entire television network that targets fear, uncertainty and doubt. Amplifies them. In a strange sort of way the right wing TV stations of the world just copy the same play-book used by the various religions.

Anyway.

Enough pontificating.

I have jam and peanut butter to go and buy.
