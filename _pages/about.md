## About Me

![Jonathan Beckett](/assets/images/jonbeckett_newsprint.jpg)

My name is Jonathan Beckett. I am a software and web developer with extensive experience in building enterprise solutions, automation systems, and web applications. You may also know me through my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@jonbeckett) or my personal blog at [Recursive Words](https://recursivewords.com).


## Professional Background

I am a software and web developer with many years of experience designing, building, and maintaining software systems across a range of platforms and technologies.

My professional work centres on the Microsoft ecosystem, where I specialise in document and content management systems, PowerShell automation, and workflow development using PowerAutomate. I have also worked extensively with enterprise workflow platforms including K2 and Nintex, integrating them with broader organisational systems.

More recently, my focus has expanded to include TypeScript development, behaviour-driven development using Gherkin and Cucumber, and browser automation with Playwright. I also work with DevOps pipelines to streamline deployment processes and improve software delivery.

My background includes significant experience with Linux systems and open source software. Earlier in my career, I developed one of the first widely-used blogging platforms—a project that began as a personal solution and grew into something much larger.

## Areas of Interest

My writing and research focus on several key areas:

- **Software development methodologies** and their practical application in real-world projects
- **Productivity systems** and note-taking methods, with particular interest in how they support knowledge work
- **Technology history and evolution**, exploring how current tools and practices emerged from earlier innovations
- **Development workflows** and the ongoing pursuit of more effective ways to build software

I write about these topics both to share knowledge and to deepen my own understanding. Technical writing is a valuable way to clarify complex ideas and engage with others working in similar fields.

## Beyond Technology

Outside of professional work, I maintain a range of interests:

- **Running** provides both physical exercise and time for reflection
- **Reading** spans topics from history to science, supporting broader intellectual curiosity
- **Retro computing** and vintage technology offer insight into the foundations of modern systems
- **Flight simulation** provides an engaging technical hobby

## About This Blog

This blog focuses on technology, software development, and productivity. Articles tend toward longer, more detailed explorations of topics rather than brief commentary. The goal is to provide substantive content that offers genuine value to readers working in technology and related fields.

Content is written in British English and aims to make technical subjects accessible while maintaining appropriate depth and rigour.

For more personal content and day-to-day reflections, visit my blog at [Recursive Words](https://recursivewords.com). Video content, primarily focused on flight simulation, is available on my [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@jonbeckett).

## Personal

I live in the United Kingdom with my family.
